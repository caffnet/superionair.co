## The Project
<span class="firstLetter">I</span>t's not every day you get a chance to break ground on some real research. Get a chance to take vendor promises and put them in a real world scenario (or as close as you can get), and see what rises to the top. Fortunately, that's exactly what I just got the chance to do. A month ago, I was given the oppurtunity to take on the task of pitting 3 of the top industry leading Anti-Bot devices against each other. Two of these devices are full featured WAFs, the third - is a purpose built device that at its core function only deals with managing automated attacks. The following posts outline the devices, the testing, my strategy and ultimately my findings. 

## The Scenario
<span class="firstLetter">D</span>uring this years BSidesSF, I had the chance to talk to a colleague who worked for an airline, and shared with me a unique problem. Their problem revolved around bot traffic, and scrapers -- and not in the usual sense. Quit literally, this company was seeing financial impact from companies legititmately scraping their website looking for the best deals on airline tickets. This issue was particularly fascinating as the impacts were not malicious, they were indeed active customers looking to purchase travel - but the way they were doing it was impacting the business financialy. In effect, driving up the cost of doing business in a very unnatural way. When the oppurtunity to take on this reseach project presented itself - what better model to use than one that was already a real world issue.

### The Company
<span class="firstLetter">T</span>hat's when SuperionAir was born. The name is a play on one of the most awesome Transformer Gen I Combiner Units - The AerialBot Superion.

It would only be fitting that a company in the Airline Industry fighting bots every day be named after one of the largest bot fighting Transformers. Over the years Superion Air has risen from a regional carrier, to assert itself as the leading value carrier in the Pacific. 

### The Problem
<span class="firstLetter">T</span>his exponential growth from small time operator, to national carrier has not been without it's sacrafices. Superion Air still runs it's IT division like it did when they were a 12 person startup. The long hours, and hard work have paid off - but the crew is reaching a breaking point. With a very small staff of dedicated IT workers, and a lone security engineer, they are looking for a way to maximize their defensive position. 
The problem with bots is a pretty big one too. You see, Superion Air recently started down the path of moving their services to the Cloud. Their Cloud Provider enticed them with some pricing that is favorable under normal load, but during spikes the costs skyrocket. The executive team are working with the provider to get the contracts renegotiated - but at the moment, they have asked the IT team, and the lone security guy to come up with a plan to mitigate their bot threat. 

<span class="firstLetter">T</span>he IT team sought out the top players in the Anti-Bot game. The arranged to setup a Proof Of Conecpt. Though, their executive leadership team decided against a PoC run by the vendors themselves. They prefered that all devices be baked off, in realtime - against identified bad traffic. After  much research the products selected were the following:

| **Vendor**       |                                                                                           | **Product**      | **Version** |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Imperva          | &nbsp; {% image imperva-logo.png alt="Imperva Logo" %} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;               | WAF              | 11.0        |
| F5 Networks      | &nbsp; {% image f5-logo.png alt="F5 Networks Logo" %}  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;               | ASM              | 11.6        |
| Distil Networks  | &nbsp; {% image distil-logo.png alt="Distil Networks Logo" %} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;        | Distil Appliance | NA          |

With these products selected, the IT group then set off to see which products could best protect their ogranization.

## Where we go from here
<span class="firstLetter">T</span>he next posts outline the Enterprise environemnt setup at Superion Air. Though this is a simulation and created in a lab environment, the narative above is what was used as the basis for the testing.
