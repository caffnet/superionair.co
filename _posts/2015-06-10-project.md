# The Project
It's not every day you get a chance to break ground on some real research. Get a chance to take vendor promises and put them in a real world scenario (or as close as you can get), and see what rises to the top. Fortunately, that's exactly what I just got the chance to do. A month ago, I was given the oppurtunity to take on the task of pitting 3 of the top industry leading Anti-Bot devices against each other. Two of these devices are full featured WAFs, the third - is a purpose built device that at its core function only deals with managing automated attacks. The following posts outline the devices, the testing, my strategy and ultimately my findings.
