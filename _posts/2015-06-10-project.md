It's not every day you get a chance to break ground on some real research. Get a chance to take vendor promises and put them in a real world scenario (or as close as you can get), and see what rises to the top. Fortunately, that's exactly what I just got the chance to do. A month ago, I was given the oppurtunity to take on the task of pitting 3 of the top industry leading Anti-Bot devices against each other. Two of these devices are full featured WAFs, the third - is a purpose built device that at its core function only deals with managing automated attacks. The following posts outline the devices, the testing, my strategy and ultimately my findings. 

# The Scenario
During this years BSidesSF, I had the chance to talk to a colleague who worked for an airline, and shared with me a unique problem. Their problem revolved around bot traffic, and scrapers -- and not in the usual sense. Quit literally, this company was seeing financial impact from companies legititmately scraping their website looking for the best deals on airline tickets. This issue was particularly fascinating as the impacts were not malicious, they were indeed active customers looking to purchase travel - but the way they were doing it was impacting the business financialy. In effect, driving up the cost of doing business in a very unnatural way. When the oppurtunity to take on this reseach project presented itself - what better model to use than one that was already a real world issue.

## The Company
That's when SuperionAir was born. The name is a play on one of the most awesome Transformer Gen I Combiner Units - The AirialBot Superion.

 It would only be fitting that a company in the Airline Industry fighting bots every day be named after one of the largest bot fighting Transformers. Over the years Superion Air has risen from a regional carrier, to assert itself as the leading value carrier in the Pacific. This exponential growth from small time operator, to national carrier
