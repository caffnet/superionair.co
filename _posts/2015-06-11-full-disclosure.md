<span class="firstLetter">T</span>esting on this scale has been not only fun, but incredibly challenging. It is important to understand the background of the ones doing the tests so you can understand the bias that is brought to the test. Every test has bias - it is in our nature as humans to draw upon our life expieriences when analyzing any given data set. This should not be construed or misrepresented as extending my availability for employment, though this may seem to some to look like a CV, in all reality, I'm pretty good where I am, and I only put this out here to give context to the testing.

* Security Architect with a large national consulting firm
* Red Team Member Western Regional Cyber Defense Competition (WRCCDC)
* Bug Bounty Participant
* Actively involved in research and contribution to _Active Defense_ 

* Things I have broken:
	+ I've gotten root on a light bulb, crock pot, and soon an egg tray
	+ Once pwned a client with nothing more than using their own administrative tools ( Solarwinds etc)
	+ A bunch of other things, that I can't really state publicly ;-)
* Things I have built:
	+ Have provided Web Application Firewall consultation, and deployment to various Fortune 500,100, and 50 clients - including major companies in the Financial Services vertical
	+ Deployed an SEIM solution for a major international company in the Oil sector.
	+ Deployed NGFW solutions for a major company in the Energy sector.
* Things I have defended:
	+ Served as the Networking lead for a University in Southern California for over 5 years
	+ Served as the Networking and Security lead for a major international automobile manufacturer for over 5 years
	+ Served on security teams in both commercial banking and merchant processing
